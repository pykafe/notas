## What is this?

The idea is that this is the place where we share information.

The Table of Contents is bellow. Each section is in a different folder and each folder has a `README.md` file in it which should provide a quick summary of that section. 


## How do I contribute to this wealth of knowledge?
Here are some simple guidelines:

- Feel free to use your favorite writing app so long as it can save plain text files.
- Documents should be saved as plain text.
- Documents should be written in [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)
- Documents file names should:
    - be all lower case and end in `.md`. The exception is `README.md`.
    - separate words with `_` underscores (example: `server_list.md`)
- Code snippets are encouraged but please provide some narrative text so 6 months from now everyone still knows what the clever code does and how it works.
